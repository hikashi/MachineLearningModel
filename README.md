MachineLearningModel
==========================
Building machine learning model based on the "O'Reilly book Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow"

Based on the book of "O'Reilly book Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow".
A proper solution woulf be readily available at [Here](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml).

Anyway, this is my attempt on tackling some problem found in the books and my little adventure into learning machine learning model.


I would like to express gratitude to such details book hands on. 
Another book to recommend would be deep Learning books by Goodfellow at [here](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/).
